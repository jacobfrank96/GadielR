        <p class="lead">My name is Gadiel (but you can call me G), here is a little information about myself and my experience.
      I am a very outgoing, loving, and caring. I am a very energetic young man, I have been working with children for about 5 years now.
      I started working full time as soon as I graduated high school. I have been with 3 different families.
      I have worked with infants and teenagers. I also have experience with a special needs. I am currently attending online and evening classes for a degree in early care and education with a minor in special needs education.
      I love working with children. I love to enrich their lives in any way I can.
      I come from a family of teachers! I also have First Aid and CPR certification.
      Here is a brief description of the duties I do for the family I currently work for. They have 3 children ages 3-13.
      I have worked with them for the past 2 1/2 years. I am very sad that I will be leaving them this year,
      their youngest little boy will be attending full day preschool and they will no longer need my assistance.
      On a daily basis I arrive at work at about 7:30, once at work I start off with getting the baby out of bed and dressed and ready for the day.
      I prepare their lunches and get them breakfast, and then out the door for the bus. During the warmer months we all walk to school together, or rode bikes to school.
      Once all of those duties are completed I get laundry and do some light house cleaning started, while the baby is finishing his breakfast.
      Depending on the day of the week we have outings that we attend, from Monday swim class, to Wednesday reading at the library,
      to Friday adventure fun day. Friday we do events such as zoo, park, museum. In the winter months we go to an indoor play house.
      We are very active. I also do errands such as Doctor, Dentist, and the basic mommy duties. I drive carpool to dance once a week as well.</p>

          <li class="padding"> "Gadiel is a wonderful babysitter. We used him for babysitting, helping with child related errands and taking to and from activities. Gadiel is upbeat, punctual, very neat and tidy and has a lovely manner with children. Gadiel merged into our household very easily without fuss, my children adored him and ask after Gadiel often. I highly recommend Gadiel."</li>
          <li class="padding"> "Gadiel was a good babysitter, he did everything I asked him to do and more. BUT I did not appreciate the way he spoke to my childer. He put on that classic, 'I'm speaking to a child so I have to change my voice in a very condesending way' voice."</li>
          <!-- <li class= "padding"> "He showed up to our residence with CPR certification. I knew right then that my kids were safe on my night out. Hire this man for the peace of mind!"</li> -->
